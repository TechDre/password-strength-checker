About
This project was developed as part of my cybersecurity learning journey. It demonstrates the practical application of Python programming concepts and security principles through a user-friendly password analysis tool.
Key Learning Objectives:

Python programming fundamentals
Security-focused software development
User interface design
Input validation and error handling
Technical documentation

‚ú® Features

 Comprehensive Analysis: Checks length, character types, and composition
 Scoring System: 0-100 scale with clear strength levels
 Smart Recommendations: Specific advice for password improvement
 Security-First: No password storage or logging
Beginner-Friendly: Clear code structure and extensive comments
Interactive Interface: Menu-driven command-line experience

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher
No additional libraries required (uses only built-in Python modules)

Installation

Clone the repository
bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-checker.git
cd password-strength-checker

Run the program
bash python simple_password_checker.py


That's it! You don't need to do any additional setup.
üíª Usage
Basic Usage: bash python simple_password_checker.py
Menu Options

Check a password - Analyze password strength
Learn about password security - View security tips
Exit - Close the program

Command Line Tips

Your password input is visible (this is the beginner version)
The program never stores or logs your passwords
Use Ctrl+C to exit at any time

üìä Example Output
üîí SIMPLE PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER
==================================================

Password: ******** (hidden for security)
Length: 12 characters

REQUIREMENT CHECKLIST:
------------------------------
‚úì Length (8+ characters): PASS
‚úì Uppercase letters: PASS  
‚úì Lowercase letters: PASS
‚úì Numbers: PASS
‚úó Special characters: FAIL

OVERALL SCORE: 80/100
STRENGTH LEVEL: Very Strong

RECOMMENDATIONS:
------------------------------
1. Add special characters (!, @, #, etc.)
==================================================
üîß Technical Details
Password Requirements Checked

Length: Minimum 8 characters (recommended 12+)
Uppercase Letters: A-Z
Lowercase Letters: a-z
Numbers: 0-9
Special Characters: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?

Scoring Algorithm
Each requirement contributes 20 points to the total score:

Length requirement: 20 points
Uppercase letters: 20 points
Lowercase letters: 20 points
Numbers: 20 points
Special characters: 20 points

Strength Levels

Very Strong: 80-100 points
Strong: 60-79 points
Moderate: 40-59 points
Weak: 20-39 points
Very Weak: 0-19 points

üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure
Python # Main functions
check_password_length()      # Validates minimum length
check_uppercase_letters()    # Detects A-Z characters
check_lowercase_letters()    # Detects a-z characters
check_numbers()             # Detects 0-9 characters
check_special_characters()  # Detects special symbols
calculate_password_score()  # Computes overall score
analyze_password()          # Orchestrates analysis
